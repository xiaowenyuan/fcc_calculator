This is a simple calculator built in React for FreeCodeCamp's [Front End Development project]('https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator'). 

This calculator is based on the old-school simple calculators my parents used to have. It only takes two numbers that can be operated on with the four mathematical operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide). A number can be made positive or negative by toggling the `+/-` button. Pressing `AC` clears the display and resets the calculator. After a result is obtained, if an operator is pressed, the result will be treated as the first number. 

There is keyboard input support. The app can detect numbers, the keys `+`, `-`, `/`, `x`, `*`, and `=`. The key `Enter` will result in the `=` operation, and the key `Backspace` will trigger the `AC` function.
